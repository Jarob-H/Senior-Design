# CNC Window Cleaner Project

### Overview
***
This project is my senior design project. This project goal was to deliver a solution that would allow the operators of 
the school's Machine Shop to see inside the machine during operation. This was not possible before due to coolant 
splashing against the window while the machine is operating. 


### Control / UI
***
The operations for the CNC window wiper will be controlled on a raspberry pi 4 and 7in touch screen that is mounted on 
the outside the CNC machine. 

The UI will have the following operations:
* Turn on the wipers to one of the default speeds (Slow, medium, fast)
* Turn off the wipers
* Prompt the user for a speed and amount of time they would like to run them
